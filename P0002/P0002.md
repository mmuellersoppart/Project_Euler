Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Observations

### Recursion

Fibonacci can be viewed as a recursive problem. The problem can solved by repeating the same instructions over and over. Recursion can be inefficient. I used tail-recursion (Kotlin) and memoization (Swift) to make the recursion stack safe and fast. 

My .c solution shows that the recursive solution is not necessary. The problem can be solved faster and with far less memory doing it iteratively. 

### Every third value is even

mini informal inductive like proof.

START
In natural language, we start with an even and odd number. 
odd, even, _ , _, _

An even + odd number is odd.
odd, even, odd, _, _

Again, an even + odd number will yield an odd number.
odd, even, odd, odd, _

Two odds, odd + odd, will yield an even
odd, even, odd, odd, even

And the pattern begins again.
odd, even, _, _, _

END

Because of this, one does not have to run any conditional statements.
